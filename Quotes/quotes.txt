Gene Oliver (Life and the Artistry of Change)

What's really important in life? Sitting on a beach? Looking a television eight hours a day? I think we have to appreciate that we're alive for only a limited period of time, and we'll spend most of our lives working. That being the case, I believe one of the most important priorities is to do whatever we do as well as we can. We should take pride in that.

I believe life is a series of near misses. A lot of what we ascribe to luck is not luck at all. It's seizing the day and accepting responsibility for your future. It's seeing what other people don't see and pursuing that vision.

Decisions

When making a decision of minor importance, I have always found it advantageous to consider all the pros and cons. In vital matters, however, such as the choice of a mate or a profession, the decision should come from the unconscious, from somewhere within ourselves. In the important decisions of personal life, we should be governed, I think, by the deep inner needs of our nature.
Sigmund Freud

One's mind has a way of making itself up in the background, and it suddenly becomes clear what one means to do.

We grow great by dreams. All big men are dreamers. They see things in the soft haze of a spring day or in the red fire of a long winter's evening.

Yet it is in our idleness, in our dreams, that the submerged truth sometimes comes to the top.
Virginia Woolf (A Room of One's Own)

What dreaming does is give us the fluidity to enter into other worlds by destroying our sense of knowing this world… Dreaming is a journey of unthinkable dimensions, a journey that, after making us perceive everything we can humanly perceive, makes the assemblage point jump outside the human domain and perceive the inconceivable.

Teenagers go to college to be with their boyfriends and girlfriends; they go because they can't think of anything else to do; they go because their parents want them to and sometimes because their parents don't want them to; they go to find themselves, or to find a husband, or to get away from home, and sometimes even to find out about the world in which they live.

We all want to fall in love. Why? Because that experience makes us feel completely alive. Where every sense is heightened, every emotion is magnified, our everyday reality is shattered and we are flying into the heavens. It may only last a moment, an hour, an afternoon. But that doesn't diminish its value. Because we are left with memories that we treasure for the rest of our lives. When love is not madness, it is not love

Gilbert K. Chesterton  
Men

In this society, the norm of masculinity is phallic aggression. Male sexuality is, by definition, intensely and rigidly phallic. A man's identity is located in his conception of himself as the possessor of a phallus; a man's worth is located in his pride in phallic identity. The main characteristic of phallic identity is that worth is entirely contingent on the possession of a phallus. Since men have no other criteria for worth, no other notion of identity, those who do not have phalluses are not recognized as fully human.

Men cease to interest us when we find their limitations.
Ralph Waldo Emerson

The world men inhabit is rather bleak. It is a world full of doubt and confusion, where vulnerability must be hidden, not shared; where competition, not co-operation, is the order of the day; where men sacrifice the possibility of knowing their own children and sharing in their upbringing, for the sake of a job they may have chosen by chance, which may not suit them and which in many cases dominates their lives to the exclusion of much else.

Men make the mistake of thinking that because women can't see the sense in violence, they must be passive creatures. It's just not true. In one important way, at least, men are the passive sex.

On the other hand, what women want is stability, which when you stop to think about it is a very different animal.

Mistakes

If you have made mistakes... there is always another chance for you... you may have a fresh start any moment you choose, for this thing we call failure is not the falling down, but the staying down.
Mary Pickford

It is necessary for us to learn from others' mistakes. You will not live long enough to make them all yourself.
Hyman George Rickover

Some of the best lessons we ever learn are learned from past mistakes. The error of the past is the wisdom and success of the future.
Dr. Dale E. Turner  
Mistakes

People who make no mistakes lack boldness and the spirit of adventure. They are the brakes on the wheels of progress.
Dr. Dale E. Turner  
Mistakes

It is the highest form of self-respect to admit our errors and mistakes and make amends for them. To make a mistake is only an error in judgment, but to adhere to it when it is discovered shows infirmity of character.
Dr. Dale E. Turner  
Mistakes

In all the work we do, our most valuable asset can be the attitude of self-examination. It is forgivable to make mistakes, but to stand fast behind a wall of self-righteousness and make the same mistake twice is not forgivable.
Dr. Dale E. Turner

Learn from the mistakes of others. You can't live long enough to make them all yourself.

You must learn from your past mistakes, but not lean on your past successes.
Denis Waitley  
Mistakes

When you make a mistake or get ridiculed or rejected, look at mistakes as learning experiences, and ridicule as ignorance. . . . Look at rejection as part of one performance, not as a turn down of the performer.
Denis Waitley

To make mistakes is human; to stumble is commonplace; to be able to laugh at yourself is maturity.
William Arthur Ward  
Mistakes

Would you like me to give you a formula for... success? It's quite simply, really. Double your rate of failure... You're thinking of failure as the enemy of success. But it isn't at all... You can be discouraged by failure, or you can learn from it. So go ahead and make mistakes. Make all you can. Because, remember that's where you'll find success. On the far side of failure.
Thomas John Watson, Sr. (President of IBM)

Music is your own experience, your own thoughts, your wisdom. If you don't live it, it won't come out of your horn. They teach you there's a boundary line to music. But, man, there's no boundary line to art.

We are a spectacular, splendid manifestation of life. We have language ... We have affection We have genes for usefulness, and usefulness is about as close to a 'common goal' of nature as I can guess at. And finally, and perhaps best of all, we have music.
Lewis Thomas  
Music

When I hear music, I fear no danger. I am invulnerable. I see no foe. I am related to the earliest times, and to the latest.

Don't bother discussing sex with small children. They rarely have anything to add.
Fran Lebowitz  
Sex

Life without sex might be safer but it would be unbearably dull. It is the sex instinct which makes women seem beautiful, which they are once in a blue moon, and men seem wise and brave, which they never are at all. Throttle it, denaturalize it, take it away, and human existence would be reduced to the prosiac, laborious, boresome, imbecile level of life in an anthill.
Henry Louis Mencken

Success seems to be connected with action. Successful men keep moving. They make mistakes, but they don't quit.

The essence of success is that it is never necessary to think of a new idea oneself. It is far better to wait until somebody else does it, and then to copy him in every detail, except his mistakes.

To laugh often and much;/To win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;/To earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends;/To appreciate beauty, to find the best in others;/To leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch or a redeemed social condition;/To know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived./This is to have succeeded.
